## [Unreleased]

- ### D11 version bump
  D11 version bump
---

- ### Remove debug logging from Goodkind bot
  Needed to push the Goodkind chat bot to sandboxes for testing as it only works on a specified public domain. Included debug logging in case of issues, but this is no longer needed.
  
  Resolves #82 
---

- ### #80 Adds Goodkind bot to external service
  Adds the Goodkind AI chatbot to External Services. Cannot test locally, gets a 500 error. Need to test on developer sandbox.
  
  Resolves #80 
---

- ### #78 Adds update to remove newsletter view
  Previously disabling the "Newsletters by Type" view would continue to cannibalize the "Taxonomy Terms" view page and result in a blank page due to both views sharing a path by default. This could only be disabled by changing the path, then disabiling the view on live sites, in order to correctly render the taxonomy view.
  
  This update hook should disable the newsletter-specific view and allow the taxonomy view to handle all terms correctly, after running a `drush updb` command on the live sites
  
  Resolves #78 
---

- ### Removes unused include templates and settings (v2.11)
  This update removes the unused includes and settings originally intended for the CU Boulder homepage secondary and footer menus. They have instead built these out using the appropriate mechanisms available in Web Express and don't need custom code to support it.
  
  CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1537
  
  Sister PR in: [tiamat-theme](https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/1554)
---

- ### Updates site affiliation (v2.10)
  This update renames _Office of Integrity, Safety and Compliance_ to _Office of Compliance, Ethics and Policy_, and adds a URL to this affiliation.
  
  [change] Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#74
---

- ### Adds Sidebar color options
  Options for sidebar menu styles added. Default is the current D10 Gold, and the light gray option mimics the D7 style
  
  Sister PR: https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/1544
---

- ### Increases the maximum length of the "Content" field on third-party service entities (v2.9.1)
  Previously, a site wasn't able to include or exclude all the pages they wanted to due to a default character limit on the "Content" field on third-party services entities. This update increases the character limit to 10,000.
  
  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#72
---

- ### Update SiteConfiguration.php
  Update for the new homepage footer option as well as background color choices for the above and below content regions.
  
  Sister PR: https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/1456
---

- ### Renames Infrastructure and Sustainability to Infrastructure and Resilience (v2.9)
  [change] This update renames Infrastructure and Sustainability to Infrastructure and Resilience. This update contains an update hook.
  
  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#65
---

- ### Prepends site base URL to site-relative search page path (v2.8.6)
  [bug, severity:moderate] An issue existed where the site-relative search page path would be treated as root-relative by the browser due to a missing prefixing of the site's URL, preventing custom site search from working as expected. This update resolves the issue by correctly prefixing the site's full URL to the search page path. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#69
---

- ### Updates linter workflow
  Updates the linter workflow to use the new parent workflow in action-collection.
  
  CuBoulder/action-collection#7

  new ci workflow
---

  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#62
---

- ### Fixes People List Filter labels
  Previously there was an error in the site configuration where the set Filter 1 label would be presented for Filter 2 and Filter 3. This has been corrected and allows the People List Page to access the correct term labels.
  
  Resolves #60 
---

- ### Fixes bug with site frontpage setting (v2.8.4)
  [Bug] Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#56
---

- ### Removes "social share position" setting (v2.8.3)
  [Remove] CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#1073
  
  Sister PR in: [tiamat-theme](https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/1078)
---

- ### Renames menu styles (v2.8.2)
  This update renames menu styles to more generic names.
  
  - Highlight -> Light 1
  - Ivory -> Light 2
  - Layers -> Dark 1
  - Minimal -> Light 3
  - Modern -> Dark 2
  - Rise -> Light 4
  - Shadow -> Dark 3
  - Simple -> Dark 4
  - Spirit -> Light 5
  - Swatch -> Dark 5
  - Tradition -> Light 6
  
  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#53
---

- ### Fixes third-party services set to "all content" appearing on content in the exclude field (v2.8.1)
  Apparently Drupal's query API is so limiting that they actively encourage [duplicating the exact same code 3 times](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/database-api/dynamic-queries/conditions#s-using-not-in-with-multi-value-field-like-roles-user-entity) in the documentation, big yikes. Instead of a query condition this update just grabs all of them and uses PHP to filter some out.
  
  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#51
---

- ### CU Boulder Site Configuration v2.8
  This update:
  - [New] Adds Service Cloud third-party service and associated configuration. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#46
  - [Bug] Refactors third-party services yet again to fix a bug with the previous implementation.
  - [Bug] Prevents third-party services from being attached to admin pages. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#50
  - [Bug] Fixes Shortcodes not rendering correctly in the site contact info block. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_migration_shortcodes#15
  
  Sister PR in: [tiamat-theme](https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/702)
---

- ### Third-party services update (v2.7)
  This update:
  - Changes the behavior of the "All content" option on third-party service entities:
     - When selected, the content field no longer hides, but instead becomes an exclude field.
     - The third-party service is excluded from content in this field, the inverse of the include behavior.
  - Refactors third-party services by moving all associated code into the Site Configuration module. In the future, a sister PR in tiamat-theme is unlikely to be necessary.
  
  Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#47
  
  Sister PR in: [tiamat-theme](https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/671)
---

- ### CU Boulder Site Configuration v2.6.4
  This update:
  - Fixes an error in Drupal 10.2 caused by a dependency on a `ThemeSettingsForm` class marked as internal. This dependency has been removed. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#43
  - Moves "Sidebar position" under Advanced in Appearance and layout, with the setting now expecting a value of either `left` or `right`. Updates are needed in the theme and profile to make the setting work and will be tagged as sister PRs, but aren't required to merge this PR. CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#633.
  
  @jnicholCU assigned as the reviewer to test the primary fix of this update.

- ### Adds label fields for "Department" and "Job Type" on People List Pages
  CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#626
  
  Sister PR in: [tiamat-theme](https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/636)
---

- ### CU Boulder Site Configuration v2.6.2
  This update changes "Display links in the secondary menu as buttons" to "Secondary menu button display" with options for none, blue, gold, and gray. The setting only appears if "Position of the secondary menu" is set to "Above the main navigation". CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#551

    Changes the People List `Filter 1`, `Filter 2`, and `Filter 3` custom labels to a Global Setting in Site Configuration, rather than being set per-page. These labels will be set under Configuration => Cu Boulder Site Settings => Appearance and Layout.

-   ### Adds home page setting to CU Boulder site settings

    This update to CU Boulder Site Configuration:

    -   Adds a new home page setting to CU Boulder site settings. Resolves CuBoulder/tiamat-theme#506
    -   Adds a new `edit ucb site pages` permission:
        -   Architect, Developer, and Site Manager have been given this new permission. 
        -   While "Pages" could eventually be split off into its own tab, the settings are found under "General", at least for now. The existing settings in "General" still require `edit ucb site general` to access.
    -   Cleans up PHP files in CU Boulder Site Configuration according to Drupal coding standards. Full compliance has not yet been achieved. CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration#27
